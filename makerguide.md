This guide a concise how to for setting up the  **pibot** python modules for distributed through **PyPi** (*Python Package Index) so that it can be installed using **PIP** )recursive acronym - Pip Installs Packages).

###Getting Started.
The user guide has got me as far as preparing the package that I have now hosted on github:[https://github.com/pi-bot/pibot-pkg](https://github.com/pi-bot/pibot-pkg)
See the repo for setup files etc. Will now go through steps for cloning this and uploading to PiPy. 

```
git clone https://github.com/pi-bot/pibot-pkg.git
```

Then we go into the root directory and build the package .zip file for uploading to PyPi.
